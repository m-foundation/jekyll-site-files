                    <p>Pursuing engineering in a reputed college was my dream. As I was from a middle class family, and since my parents had several other commitments, arranging finance for my studies (engineering in good college) was a worry. At the end of my Diploma I got to know about M Foundation and I got more motivated to work still harder to secure a seat in my dream college as I received assurance of financial support from M Foundation. My parents did not have to worry for arranging college fees for their son now. I could fully focus on my studies and career as I didn't have the burden of arranging finance. I did multiple projects, attended few conferences and received job offers from two companies with appreciable package.</br>
                    Yes. I would not have accomplished all these without the M Foundation support!. I am ever grateful for your help.  They doing a great job by helping less privileged students like me to make their dream come true. 
                    Thank you very much</br>
                    Now I am working in M/S. Atlas Copco as design engineer (from July 16)</p>

                    <p>I am very thankful to M Foundation and Jayantha sir.<br>
                    As I was from rural background and my family was economical backward, M Foundation scholarship has helped me a lot in buying books, study materials and paying room rents while I was studying. It would have been difficult to my family to support my education without this scholarship.<br>
                    I am very happy to share with you that, even before my graduation I had two offers in my hand, 1 from SPAN InfoTech Bangalore(2.5 Lpa) and 1 from Tejas Networks Bangalore(5.5 Lpa). <br>
                    From my graduation till today I am working in Tejas Networks Company in product verification team. I am very happy with my position in company and also able to support my family economically.</p>
